# hangman
The card hangman project of BeCode

## description 
The goal of the project is to code a functional version of the popular word guessing game Hangman in Python that can be played from the console.
The aim of the exercise is to work with classes, and familiarize oneself with OOP

## installation 
In order to run the game, it suffices to run main.py in the hangman folder from the console.

## usage 
When the game starts, you will be shown a line of blank spaces representing the length of the word to guess.
You can guess one letter at a time until you manage to guess the entire word.

## timeline 
The project took me roughly a day and a half to get close to completion, but I kept struggling with one specific error.

## personal situation 
This project was done as part of the AI Boocamp at BeCode.org.
